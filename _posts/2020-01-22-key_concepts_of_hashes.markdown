Using arrays in Ruby is so friendly and intuitive, it's almost feels like upgrading compared to languages like Java and C++. I dont even have to tell the array which object its going to hold and it will adapt to the code and store it. When I did my first project in OOP with C++, I had to use an array of arrays and not use vectors or any library that would make it easier for me because I had to understand the little intricacies of how arrays worked in a language like C++. Let me be the first to tell you, it is not fun at all! Especially when it comes to deep copy vs shallow copy, garbage collection and creating "linked lists," I can now appreciate ruby so much more for how very nice and simple it makes things for a developer. Now onto the topic of hashes is taking that power to the next level! I can make an array of arrays, an array of hashes, a hash of arrays, a hash of hashes and of course I can go even deeper! An hash of arrays of arrays and iterating through such a collection like that with confidence is why Ruby is just so lovely!
