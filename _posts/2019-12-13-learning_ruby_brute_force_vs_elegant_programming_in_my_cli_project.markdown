Having some experience in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) from C++, Java, the core concepts are translated fairly easily, but the implementation is always a different challenge. Computing today is fairly "cheap" in terms of cost processing and most internet speeds are far exceptional, but that doesn't mean we should ever just churn a bunch of code together just to make it work, at least not for the end result. I learned a few things along the way that made me understand key concepts deeper, and I made it work but I always asked myself for the first time, "what could I do better?" Let's start from the beginning.

The way I've been coding is by facing that battle head on and just going at it, through small, frustrating steps that eventually lead to that victory, but just like John Travolta above, I end up looking around  confused, "why is that bug here and why did I choose to implement something in this way?! What was I thinking of course it was bound to break!" I mean its always worked right? Whats the issue? Well the main issues are from a different set of eyes, is my code easy to understand and can someone appreciate it as a "story" and not a puzzle. </p>

Another issue is being afraid to change! Sometimes that lightbulb pops up and something just "clicks" and it's not a bad thing to run with, even if it means changing a majority of whats already working. Perseverance is not only rewarding, its a sign of improvement! Another issue is being afraid to change!

And finally, the biggest takeaway for me so far is I must learn how to implement testing properly. The concept of TDD (Test-Driven Development) is extremely helpful in keeping things simple, and to "not build a bridge on both ends." If we design tests with certain specifications and goals in mind, we make sure to build a stable base and avoid having to align both ends of a bridge that will more than likely not align.

These challenges are always appreciated and the best thing us developers do is always learn, and strive to solve problems. I look forward to developing projects that are more scalable and that are much more interactive because the appeal especially to me, is to make things work and look nice!
