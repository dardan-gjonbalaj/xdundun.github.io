First off, I'll go ahead and say, I love Ruby. I know that might not be common or even uncommon, but its just such a nice simple "get to the point im trying to help you friend" language. Now working with my first framework like Sinatra, I will be the first to admit the idea of working with an API just seemed like a task I was nowhere near prepared for. For my sinatra project, I found the process of learning ActiveRecord and ORM to be interesting and not too difficult, I enjoyed finally getting to understand routes and the power behind the MVC environment, but I was finally ready to challenge myself to take a resource that I didn't create and implement it. I found the RSpotify gem which is an api designed for Ruby to work with the API from Spotify itself, and I was worried I would end up spending way too much time trying to implement something catchy when I wasn't prepared to. However I started to get the idea behind requests and what they mean, how do I want to grab a collection and what am I looking for spefically and I started to think about the bigger picture and how even the idea behind these API designs are for simplicity and to avoid extra "cost." So my Sinatra project as of now queries a search and finds the collection of URL's to the spotify website that best match that description and provides a link for the user to click!
