Wrapping up everything that I've learned so far at Flatiron, one of the qualities that I believe I've really improved on is not being afraid of trying new ways to do things. You can really enrich your understanding and skillset by challenging yourself but it requires you to be <b> bold </b> and sometimes break everything thats already working! 
<p>I'll start with an example that isnt really "breaking" anything but it helped me tremendously with imrpoving on my css. I went with bootstrap for my javascript project but decided to dive deeper in my react project with sass. Sure using bootstrap is absolutely fine and is a wonderful tool that I really appreciate, but I wanted to add more of a personal touch to the styling of my react project. Learning about how I should choose classnames and breaking down the heirarchy of components to style things individually was a bit challenging at first but as I improved I began to use pseudo classes with ease! </p>
<p>A more challenging aspect is redux and setting up a proper flow for handling ajax requests and making full use of redux-thunk. Initially, using local react states and avoiding redux for the problem at hand required me then to refactor so much of the code that I had spent so much time on, but made for a tremendously good change that redux was now handling mapping the states! This also made the ajax calls async using redux-thunk correctly! </p>
<p>A byproduct of the previous challenges was getting more comfortable with functional components over class components and that became easier as I learned how to implement hooks into my code. I don't really have the extensive knowledge to decide really what is more optimal as of yet, but the consensus seems to be that functional components with hooks should be better for performance and such. It was something that seems trivial now but was difficult for me to wrap my head around until I actually used the hook correctly!</p>
I will look back at this journey and realize how much more I will probably know then compared to now, but a house is made by a lot of little bricks, so the foundation should remain sound but the more bricks can always make a bigger house!
